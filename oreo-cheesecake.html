          For cookies and cream fanatics, there’s nothing better than Oreo cheesecake. This cheesecake is baked in an
          Oreo crust and topped with white chocolate ganache, whipped cream, and even more <br><br>
          Cookies and cream ice cream is pretty amazing, but better suited for hot summer days. The rest of the year you
          could make something like Oreo brownies or a cookies and cream cake, but nothing truly embraces the spirit of
          cookies and cream quite like a velvety Oreo Cheesecake.

          This Oreo cheesecake starts with an Oreo crust filled with a baked cheesecake filling mixed with crushed
          Oreos. After cooling, the top of the cake is coated with smooth white chocolate ganache and decorated with
          whipped cream and even more Oreos. It’s indulgent, nostalgic, and unmistakably cookies and cream.

        <h3 class="p-3">How To Bake a Cheesecake in a Water Bath</h3>
        <p class="p-3">
          A water bath is the secret to making a luxurious, velvety cheesecake. Sure, you can skip the water bath and
          still make a delightful cheesecake, but the improved texture is worth the extra step. A water bath serves a
          dual purpose: <span class="bold">It raises the humidity of the oven preventing a crust from forming on top,
            and it heats the cheesecake slowly and evenly for a silkier texture.</span><br><br>

          To use a water bath, you will need a pan larger than the springform cake pan. You can use a larger cake pan, a
          roasting pan, a Dutch oven, or even a large foil roasting pan. Wrap the outside of the springform pan with
          several layers of aluminum foil, then set it in the roasting pan. <br><br>

          Springform pans are not water-tight, so the foil helps keep the water out. Place the nested pans in the
          preheated oven and carefully pour boiling water into the roasting pan until it reaches halfway up the sides of
          the springform pan. Then close the oven, bake, and await an extra luscious cheesecake.

      <h3 class="p-3">Soften the Cream Cheese to Room Temperature</h3>
      <p class="p-3">To make the smoothest cheesecake, soften the cream cheese to room temperature before mixing. Beat
        cream cheese with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed before adding the eggs to ensure it’s perfectly
        smooth and lump-free. If it’s not softened and blended first, the batter will have lumps that remain in the cake
        once baked.</p>
      <h3 class="p-3">How Can I Prevent My Cheesecake From Cracking?</h3>
      <p class="p-3">Cracks form when a cheesecake over bakes or when it undergoes temperature changes too quickly.
        While cracks affect the appearance of your cake, it won’t actually affect the taste too much unless the cake is
        severely overbaked. Chances are, even if the cake cracks, it will still taste excellent. That said, there are a
        few techniques you can try to prevent cracking for a perfectly smooth cheesecake.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Mix the cheesecake batter on low or medium-low speed.</span> Beating at too high a speed
          incorporates too much air into the batter. The air will expand during baking and collapse as the cake cools,
          causing cracks to form.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Cheesecakes benefit from low, slow, even baking.</span> Bake the cheesecake at 325°F and
          use a water bath if you can.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have a convection oven, <span class="bold">it’s best not to use the fan or convection function </span>
          for cheesecakes, since they’re more prone to overbaking.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you remove the cake from the oven, <span class="bold">let it cool in the water bath for an hour </span>
          before letting it cool on a rack. This lets the cake cool more gradually, so it's less likely to crack. If you
          skipped the water bath, let it cool in the oven with the door ajar for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="bold">Even if your cheesecake cracks, it will still be delicious. </span> Plus, you can disguise
          the cracks under a layer of white chocolate ganache so no one will know.
        </li>
