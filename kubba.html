                    Run the mixture through a meat grinder or food processor to form a paste.</p>
                    <h3 class="p-3">Assembly</h3>
                    <p class="p-3">Get two gallon-sized ziplock bags and slit the side seams using a knife or scissors, then cut off the part that seals the bag. Rub the inside of the bags with a small amount of oil.

                        Mold ⅛ portion of the paste into a ball. Place in the center of the plastic bag. Cover with the other half.
                        
                        Flatten into a thin circle using a rolling pin. If wrinkles form in the plastic, just lift up the plastic and re-adjust it. </p>

                </div>
                <p class="p-3">
                    Lift up on the plastic that’s covering the paste. Use a 10" plate to trace out a circle. 

                    Go around the edges with your finger, removing the extra dough.

                <p class="p-3">
                    Grab the edges of the plastic bag and set aside. Repeat with another portion of paste, on the remaining plastic bag. Add filling over one of the circles, leaving ½″ to 1″ border uncovered.</p>

                <p class="p-3">
                    Align the other shell over the one with the filling. Press down on the plastic-covered disc, beginning in the center and working your way toward the edges. This is done to remove any air bubbles and to seal the kubba.</p>

                <img class="rounded m-3" height="300vh" width="300vw" 
                src="https://hildaskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kubba-8-10.jpg" alt="">
                 
                    <p class="p-3"> Flip the Kubba over to the other side and repeat the steps.
                        Carefully peel back one of the plastic bags. Use the sides of your pointer fingers to build up the edges by lightly pushing the edges towards the center of the kubba. (see video below)
                        Cover the finished kubba with a piece of saran wrap that’s long enough to wrap all the way around it. Flip the Kubba over so that the plastic wrap is on the bottom. Carefully peel back the plastic bag and allow the Kubba to dry out.
                        After approximately 30 minutes, fold the plastic wrap over it. Repeat with the remaining ingredients</p>

                        <p class="p-3">
                            Stack the dried and wrapped Kubba on a ray and place it in the freezer.
                             Once frozen, they can be stored in large freezer bags.</p>

                        <h3 class="p-3">How To Cook Kubba Mosul</h3>
                        <p class="p-3">There are a few different ways that you can cook the Kubba. These options include boiling, frying, and baking. My favorite method is the last one.</p>
                        <h3 class="p-3">Boiling</h3>
                        <p class="p-3">Boil water in a pan that's large enough to fit the Kubba into. Next, add Kubba and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until cooked through.</p>
                        <img class="rounded m-3" height="300vh" width="300vw" 
                        src="https://hildaskitchenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/kubba-mousel-5-1.jpg" alt="">
                        <p class="p-3">Carefully use a few spatulas to remove the Kubba from the pan. Alternatively, you can partially cover the pan with a lid to drain the water from the pan and slide the Kubba out.</p> 
                        <h3 class="p-3">Frying</h3>
                        <p class="p-3">Add a few tablespoons of oil to a pan and fry the kubba for a few minutes on each side or until the Kubba is brown and crispy. </p>
                        <h3 class="p-3">Baking</h3>
                        <p class="p-3">Brush both sides of the Kubba with oil. Preheat oven to 400-degrees F. Next, wrap in aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes if fresh, or longer if frozen.</p> 
                        <h3 class="p-3">What To Serve With Kubba Mosul</h3>
                        <p class="p-3">Kubba is usually sliced in quarters and served with a Middle Eastern Salad and Pickled Mangos or Amba.
                        Here's another option, just grab a slice in your hands and eat it like a sandwich. But whatever you do, 
                        don't spill any of that yummy filling!</p>
