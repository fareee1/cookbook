        <p class="p-3">
          Spaghetti and meatballs is such a comfort food classic. The meatballs are made from ground beef and Italian
          sausage and served with a sauce made with mushrooms, onions, basil, and Parmesan.
          Spaghetti and meatballs, what's not to love? Spaghetti and meatballs has to be one of the most fun dishes ever
          invented, at least from a kid's perspective.
          Mounds of spaghetti, fork twirling strands in a spoon, tasty meatballs, trying to lift just the right amount
          from
          the bowl—these are some of my favorite memories from childhood.
          This particular spaghetti and meatballs recipe was given to us by Rick Mindermann of our local Italian grocery
          store Corti Brothers. Rick is one of these walking encyclopedias of food knowledge, whose enthusiasm for all
          things food and cooking is infectious.
          I adapted the following recipe slightly from Rick's original, and we love it! My father even declared the
          other
          day that from here on out, this is how we are making meatballs.

        <h3 class="p-3">Tips for making the best meatballs</h3>
        <p class="p-3">
          It's all about the meatballs, right? Here are some tips to ensure that yours are the best:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Mix the meats:</span> Use a combination of ground beef and Italian pork sausage for the
            best flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Include chopped mushrooms:</span> Mushrooms release moisture while they cook, so not only
            does including mushrooms
            in
            your meatball mixture add flavor, it helps keep the meatballs from drying out.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Use a light hand:</span> Don't over-mix the ingredients or the meatballs will be tough.
            Work the ingredients just
            enough so that the mixture comes together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Cook in batches:</span> Rather than crowd the pan, cook the meatballs in batches in a
            single layer.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3 class="p-3">Why San Marzano Tomatoes?</h3>
        <p class="p-3">Your tomato sauce will only be as good as your tomatoes! San Marzano tomatoes are an Italian
          variety of plum tomatoes (a.k.a. Roma tomatoes) with fewer seeds and thicker flesh that are particularly well
          suited for tomato sauce.
          <br><br>
          Canned San Marzanos are pricier than other canned tomatoes but, in my opinion, well worth it. If you can't
          find them, just use canned plum or Roma tomatoes.
        </p>

        <h3 class="p-3">Making Ahead and Storing Meatballs</h3>
        <p class="p-3">
          You can make the meatballs and sauce a day or so ahead of time if you like, and store them in the fridge in a
          covered container. Just reheat in a saucepan or in the microwave when it's time to make the spaghetti.
          <br><br>
          Spaghetti and meatballs will keep for 3 to 4 days covered and in the fridge. The meatballs will freeze better
          than the spaghetti, but you can freeze both.
        </p>
